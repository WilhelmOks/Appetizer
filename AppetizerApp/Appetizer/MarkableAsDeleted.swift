/// This is a wrapper for `Element`s of `Collection`s where each element can be marked as deleted but will remain in the collection.
/// The main purpose of this wrapper is for using it in collections whose elements are being used as bindings inside of ForEach statements in SwiftUI.
/// Removing an element from a collection would cause a crash in ForEach.
/// Instead, using collections with elements of this type, each element can be marked as deleted instead of removing it, which will prevent the crash.
/// When the elements are being constructed in ForEach, those marked as deleted can be skipped by using the if statement.
/// Collections that have this type as their element's type have convenience functions for accessing the deleted state.
